### Federated Machine Learning
This module provides several prepared federated algorithms for users. To take advantage of these algorithms,
you can set up the parameters of data io as well as the algorithm itself. Here is an example of [runtime_conf](../workflow/conf/default_runtime_conf.json).
The detailed documentation of parameters is [here](./param/README.md)

### Algorithm List
1. [Logistic Regression](./logistic_regression/)

2. [SecureBoost](./tree)

3. [Secure Federated Transfer Learning](./ftl)


More available algorithms are coming soon.
